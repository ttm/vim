" basic run: \z to create color variables based on the cursor position
" and \x to change color under cursor.
" MakeColorsWindow dont match colors in the window made by running colors.vim
"
" All commands are in <C-\> namespace and are valid for all modes.
" Start the system with <C-\>I (reloads all files from all plugins)
" or <C-\>i (reloads current file) 
" Look at the global variables g:colors_all and g:colors_all_ after
" starting.
" Check mappings in realcolor/mappings.vim to grasp overall functionality

" * Think about making a mode to ease the syntax highlighting

" * hlsearch and spellbad should one be bold and underline to avoid

" Further notes: {{{
" Color many of the substitute patterns.
" Color the @" and @. registers.

" Make colorscheme with X11 colors:
" :echo filter(copy(colors_all['named1']), 'v:val[0:2]=="X11"')
"
" syntax change undo
" increment/decrement rgb
" in the char under cursor

" start a function that receives
" the modifications throug the
" keys RGB and before it (rewq, gfds, bvcx).
" for backgound, press j and use the same keys.
" uppercase is used for more resolution.

" q quits.

" Another functionality:
" Makes a color pallete from the special colors
" or other palletes that are special or
" that are derived from a color or set of colors.

" Another functionality:
" swap two colors grabed from cursor.
" rotate all the colors maintaining the background
" or not.

" find make tests with synID trans false and true
" We have the syngroups givem by synstack
" and the effectively used one, given
" by synIDtrans

" their name might be found with

" If set hi group from synstack,
